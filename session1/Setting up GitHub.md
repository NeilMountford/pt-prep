# Setup

In this session you'll create a GitHub account so that you can get the material we've prepared for you.

## 1. Sign up for an account
Before you can do anything else you'll need to sign up for a GitHub account if you don't have one already.

1. Go to the [GitHub join page](https://github.com/join)
2. Fill in the form
    - Choose a username
    - Enter your email address (make sure it's one you have access to as you'll get a verification email later)
    - Choose a password
    - Follow the verification steps
3. Click Create an account at the bottom of the page once you've done the above
4. You'll be prompted to select a subscription, just choose the Free one and click Continue
5. On the next page you need to check one of the options for your level of programming experience and then check the boxes on what you plan to use GitHub for (if it's your first time programming then choose "None-I don't program at all" for the first section and "Creating a website with GitHub pages" for the second section)
6. You should get a verification email to the address you used to sign up with, click the link in the email to confirm your account

## 2. Fork the starter repository
Now that you have an account you will need to copy the starting repository we have created to your account. This will allow you to make your own changes to it throughout the week. This concept of copying is called "forking" in GitHub.

1. Go to the [starter repository](https://github.com/OmNomRarg/pt-web)
2. Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the page. You'll need to wait a little while for it to copy
3. You should now be taken to the page for your copy of the repository
    - If you accidentally close the browser at any point you can find your repository again by going to the [GitHub page](https://github.com/) whilst logged in. You'll see a list of repositories on the left, click the one that has your username in it

## 3. Use your repository for GitHub pages
GitHub has built in functionality to use a repository as a webpage and host it for you. By enabling this you will be able to view your blog page on the internet as you develop it.

1. From your fork of the starter repository, click the "Settings" section near the top
2. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
3. In the "Source" dropdown choose "master branch"
4. You should now be able to go to your GitHub page. The url will be https://<YourUsernameHere>.github.io/pt-web
    - If you go back to the GitHub pages settings you can also get the url from there (it will say "Your site is published at...")
5. You should now see a page with "Your blog!"
